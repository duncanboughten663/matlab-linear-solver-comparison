## 📚 Description

This MATLAB project helps you compare the performance of different methods for solving equations of the form Ax = b. It includes both direct methods like Gaussian Elimination and iterative methods like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel. By using this application, you can easily see the time taken and iterations needed for each method.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Multiple Methods:** Supports Gaussian Elimination, Gauss-Jordan Elimination, LU Decomposition, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR).
- **Performance Analysis:** Measure time and iterations for each method.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for easy navigation and understanding.
